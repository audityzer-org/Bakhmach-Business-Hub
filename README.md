- Automated quality checks

### 3. **Production Service** (`/services`)
API design, scalability, caching, observability, and resilience patterns.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Microservices architecture
- Load testing results
- Monitoring & alerting dashboards
- Disaster recovery playbooks

### 4. **Daily Workflow** (`/workflow`)
Personal optimization, task management, habit tracking, and life-work balance systems.
